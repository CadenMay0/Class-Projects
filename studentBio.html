			<p>My dad worked with programming and web development throughout his career and instilled in me a passion for the topic. My first love is game development and I've spent some time working out various projects in my free time. 
			However I know and accept that very few people "make it" in the video game industry and as a result I'm working my way through the motions to get a proper developer job. 	
			 I've spent 3 years working with java, 1 year working with c++, and ocassional months of time over the course of 4 years working on java script. I'm currently in the process of learning full stack web development to make myself a marketable person in the work force.
